Today I’m here to answer the question, “Why is a home inspection so important?”&nbsp;

**As far as homebuyers are concerned, a home inspection gives you the most honest, accurate picture of a home’s condition.** Sellers don’t always know about everything that is wrong with their property until an inspector actually comes in and takes a look.

An inspection gives you peace of mind about what you’re buying. **While no one can predict how long certain systems and appliances will last, home inspectors can point to factors that you’ll have to take under consideration when buying a home.** If you know that the home’s furnace is on its last leg, a good agent will make sure that information is factored into the offer.

If you’re like me and need a little help, it’s a smart move to have an inspector take a look at any home that you seriously consider purchasing, either for your family or as an investment. They will be able to tell you, or direct you to someone who can tell you, every imperfection in the home.
