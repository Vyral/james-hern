Zestimates are a tricky business. Yes, they can provide interesting insight into what a home is supposedly worth, but the figure they list is often a far cry from what a real agent will tell you. So who’s right? Do agents know best, or should you trust your Zestimate, instead?

Here’s the truth: Zestimates often miss the mark. **It’s more of a “best guess” on your home’s value than an accurate calculation.&nbsp;**

A Zestimate is simply an algorithm. Unlike an agent, there’s no way it can walk through your property and see what upgrades you’ve made, what your finishes are like, or any of the other fine details that make the home unique.&nbsp;

**Trying to determine a home’s true value with a Zestimate is sort of like trying to count blades of grass from 30,000 feet in the air.&nbsp;**

You’ll get a much more accurate idea of what your home is worth when you enlist the help of a real estate professional. Local agents are able to take an up-close look at your property, accounting for every little detail as they develop an estimate of your home’s value.&nbsp;

Especially when you consider that Zestimates can be more than 20% off from your home’s true market value, the choice between this web-based algorithm and the opinion of a real, local agent is clear. Zillow’s Zestimate is more like a “guess-timate.” **If you want to find out what your home is really worth, please reach out to us.** We’d be happy to help.
