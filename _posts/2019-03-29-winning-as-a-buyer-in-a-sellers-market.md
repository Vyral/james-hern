We’re still in somewhat of a seller’s market, and people are asking us if there’s any way to find success as a homebuyer. More specifically, they want to know how to make an unbeatable offer that cuts through the competition. Here’s how we get an offer accepted.

**First, we call ahead to the seller’s agent.** We find out what’s in their seller’s best interest by asking where they’re moving, when they want to close, and so on. We want to package the offer in a way that appeals to the seller so it’s important to find out through the agent what works best.

**We’ll have a pre-qualification letter, a good earnest deposit, and shorter inspection days.** A typical inspection period is 10 days, but you can cut it down to three to five by finding out your inspector’s schedule.&nbsp;

Though good communication is always important throughout the process, you still need to make a strong offer on the home; a lowball offer won’t get you anywhere in today’s market. **The rest of the terms and conditions are tailored to the seller.**

No matter what’s going on out there in the market, we’re always here to help you accomplish your real estate goals. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
