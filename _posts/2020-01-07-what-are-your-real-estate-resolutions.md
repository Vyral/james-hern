We have a question for you: What is your real estate resolution for 2020?&nbsp;

Are you considering buying or selling this year? It may be the best time to do so. Are you looking to invest or continue investing in real estate? This is the year to do it.&nbsp;

If you aren’t ready to do any of those things, but you own a home, you may be surprised at the equity you have in your home at this very moment. Now may be the time to capitalize on that. Should you refinance? You could pull that equity out, use it to pay off bills, or invest in other things.&nbsp;
