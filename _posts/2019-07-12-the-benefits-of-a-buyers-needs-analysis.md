What is a buyer’s needs analysis?

In short, **it’s a comprehensive interview that we have with you in which we take you through the buying process and learn a little bit more than what we call the three B’s of buyers.**

If you’ve talked to other agents and the only questions they asked you about revolved around the three B’s of buyers— “beds, bath, and budget”—then you need to be cautious of working with them. Those types of agents aren’t interested in what is going to be important for you with regard to your next home. After all, **finding the perfect home involves more than asking about how many bedrooms or bathrooms you need, or about your budget.**

For example, what do you want your home to say about you? What would you like to feel when you walk into that home? Are you looking for more of a formal eating space or do you prefer an open concept?

During your buyer’s needs analysis, we’ll ask you questions that get to the core of what a dream home is like for you. When you sit down with us for this 30- to 40-minute discussion, **we’re saving you hours on the back-end because when you tell us exactly what you’re looking for, we can take you right to it.** That makes sense, doesn’t it?

If you have any questions about the buyer’s needs analysis or about buying a home in general, feel free to reach out to us. We’d love to hear from you\!
