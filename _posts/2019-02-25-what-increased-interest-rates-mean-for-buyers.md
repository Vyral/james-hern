Interest rates are going up, but what does that mean for buyers? Well, it’s not a good thing.

Most interest rate movement is negligible, but for every point that it goes up, you lose 10% of your buying power. If you have a $250,000 mortgage, each point costs you around $150 more each month. **If the rate goes up, you’re paying for it.**

Affordability has been at a 40-year low, but it’s creeping back up. The government has stopped conducting quantitative easing, **which means they’re no longer spending money to artificially keep bonds low.** Now that it’s ended, rates will begin to go up. If you want to buy a house, you should now.

If you’re approved for a $200,000 mortgage but rates go up 0.5%, you’re losing 5% of your buying power. You can now only afford a $190,000 home. With a 1% increase, that’s a decrease in buying power to $180,000. **You can see how a small change has a big effect.&nbsp;**
