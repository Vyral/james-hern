With the market shift going on, homes are staying on the market a lot longer than they used to. We’re not seeing as many multiple offers as we once did, either. This confuses sellers, who may begin to question why their house isn’t selling.

The truth is, the market is shifting from being a complete seller’s market to more of a balanced market instead. This means that, due to supply and demand, **conditions no longer strictly favor the sellers.** Buyers can afford to be slightly pickier about the homes they want to buy.

This is where we come in: It’s our job to educate home sellers about how to prepare their homes for today’s market. **Successfully selling your home in our market comes down to three things: price, condition, and location.** Sellers need to ask themselves if their house is priced correctly, if it’s in good condition, and if it’s in a good location for buyers. Of these three criteria, price is definitely a driving factor—price your home with the market in mind and you should have fewer issues finding buyers.

If you have any additional questions or would like a professional opinion about the price of your for-sale home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.
