Whether big or small, your budget should allow for certain renovations to be made when it comes time to sell your home. Here are a few renovation tips to think about:&nbsp;

One lower-cost renovation you can make is **increasing your curb appeal**. Something as simple as doing a little landscaping, mulching, or sprucing up your yard’s overall appearance by cleaning up yard waste can make a big difference.

Also a simple fix, **replacing the hardware** on your cabinet doors and any other door in your home can totally transform the look of your home.&nbsp;

The next one on the list should come as no surprise: **painting**. Especially if you have young children, your home’s walls are probably not exactly in pristine condition. Over time, the walls of a lived-home tend to have scuffs, knicks, and maybe even fingerprints. Whether it’s your walls or cabinets, applying some new paint can add a great deal of buyer appeal. &nbsp;

Let’s shift our attention to bigger-budget renovation items that will give you the greatest bang for your buck. While you can opt for a minor remodel, a full **kitchen remodel** usually returns a whopping 110% of the money you’ve spent. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

The same goes for a **bathroom remodel**, but it’s important to note that this depends on how many bathrooms are in your home. It would probably be unwise to add, say, six bathrooms when your home already has two. &nbsp;

In any case, smaller items like new tile or light fixtures will give your home a nice value boost and are likely to put every dollar you spend back into your pocket.&nbsp;

From simple to difficult and cheap to expensive, these are just a few of the great renovation options you can try in your home that will prove to be money well spent.&nbsp;
