People have been asking us a lot lately, “Why should I come into the office for a buyer’s consultation?” Well, today we have the answer. The goal of this consultation is to sit down with you for a little bit to explain how the market works for buyers from A to Z. Things change periodically, and we would love to sit down and show you how the process works in the current market so you can get a better idea of what it will look like before you make a final decision.
